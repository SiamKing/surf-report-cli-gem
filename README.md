# SurfReport

What's up brah!  This is a totally wicked program that will tell you which pipe you should hit!

## Installation

You can install this gem via `gem install surf-report-cli-gem`. The `surf-report` CLI will be installed and you can run `surf-report` to get a list of the waves you can hit now right in your command line.

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install surf_report

## Usage

Want to hit the waves today, tomorrow or the next day?  Our own surfer dude will tell you whether to hit the waves or hit the snooze!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
